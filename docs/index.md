# MongoDB Guide

This documentation has the objective of gather useful information about MongoDB that we have learnt with development and production experience, research and notes taken from [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/) courses.

This guide is not a MongoDB documentation rewrite, rather is a collection of useful commands, quick examples, tips and links to the actual MongoDB documentation.
